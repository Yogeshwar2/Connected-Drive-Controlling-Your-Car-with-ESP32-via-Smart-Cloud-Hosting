# Smart-cloud-based-car-using-ESP32-by-Yogeshwar.jb
This Project sets up a web server on an ESP32 microcontroller. It allows remote control of a car through a web interface, including movement in different directions and real-time distance measurements using an ultrasonic sensor. Ideal for building a cloud-based car control system with ESP32.
